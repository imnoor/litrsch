Waves of technology, such as the internet of things, big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, are reshaping our personal and professional lives in profound ways. A new world is emerging in which many of the current job classes will disappear, while new ones, requiring entirely different sets of skills, are emerging. Public administrators are unprepared for the challenges they must face in order to cope with this nonincremental and exponential change. Many of the existing government structures and processes that have evolved over the last few centuries will likely become irrelevant in the near future.

EA is operationalized when architecture visions move towards realization through concrete projects. We report a case study on the dynamics of operationalizing EA in the Norwegian hospital sector by exploring different EA project trajectories. Our empirical context is an institutionally pluralistic setting where multiple logics coexist. We show that the distinct logic of EA is added to the institutional context and we find that tensions among existing medical, technical, and managerial logics and EA principles and assumptions emerge. We contribute to the under-researched topic of EA operationalization by suggesting a model that demonstrates how the meeting of multiple institutional logics can lead to varying degrees of differentiation or even disassociation from EA visions during decision-taking in projects. Furthermore, we advance extant research on IS projects' implementation in institutionally pluralistic settings by providing an empirical account of actors' interactions and project leadership arrangements that contribute to the persistence of coexisting logics in a dynamic equilibrium.\"), \n",

In order to materialize the transformative potential of AI, public sector organizations need to successfully assimilate AI in their operational activities. However, AI assimilation in the public sector appears to be fragmented and lagging the private sector, and the phenomena has really limited attention from academic research community. To address this gap, we adopt the case study approach to explore three Saudi-Arabian public sector organizations and analyze the results using the attention-based view of the organization (ABV) as the theoretical lens. This study elucidates the challenges related AI assimilation in public sector in terms of how organizational attention is focused situated and distributed during the assimilation process. Five key challenges emerged from the cases studied, namely (i) misalignment between AI and management decision-making, (ii) tensions with linguistics and national culture, (iii) developing and implementing AI infrastructure, (iv) data integrity and sharing, and (v) ethical and governance concerns. The findings reveal a re-enforcing relationship between the situated attention and structural distribution of attention that can accelerate the successful assimilation of AI in public sector organizations.'), \n",

      "    ('abstract', \"Driven by ‘success stories' reported by private sector firms, government agencies have also started adopting various Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in diverse domains (e.g. health, taxation, and education); however, extensive research is required in order to exploit the full potential of AI in the public sector, and leverage various AI technologies to address important problems/needs. This paper makes a contribution in this direction: it presents a novel approach, as well as the architecture of an ICT platform supporting it, for the advanced exploitation of a specific AI technology, namely chatbots, in the public sector in order to address a crucial issue: the improvement of communication between government and citizens (which has for long time been problematic). The proposed approach builds on natural language processing, machine learning and data mining technologies, and leverages existing data of various forms (such as documents containing legislation and directives, structured data from government agencies' operational systems, social media data, etc.), in order to develop a new digital channel of communication between citizens and government. Making use of appropriately structured and semantically annotated data, this channel enables ‘richer' and more expressive interaction of citizens with government in everyday language, facilitating and advancing both information seeking and conducting of transactions. Compared to existing digital channels, the proposed approach is appropriate for a wider range of citizens' interactions, with higher levels of complexity, ambiguity and uncertainty. In close co-operation with three Greek government agencies (the Ministry of Finance, a social security organization, and a big local government organization), this approach has been validated through a series of application scenarios.\"), \n",

AI is an advanced information communication technology tool (ICT) that changes both the nature of human discretion within a bureaucracy and the structure of bureaucracies. To better understand this relationship, AI, discretion, and bureaucracy are explored in some detail. It is argued that discretion and decision-making are strongly influenced by intelligence, and that improvements in intelligence, such as those that can be found within the field of AI, can help improve the overall quality of administration. Furthermore, the characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of both human discretion and AI are explored. Once these characteristics are laid out, a further exploration of the role AI may play in bureaucracies and bureaucratic structure is presented, followed by a specific focus on systems-level bureaucracies. In addition, it is argued that task distribution and task characteristics play a large role, along with the organizational and legal context, in whether a task favors human discretion or the use of AI. Complexity and uncertainty are presented as the major defining characteristics for categorizing tasks. Finally, a discussion is provided about the important cautions and concerns of utilizing AI in governance, in particular, with respect to existential risk and administrative evil.'), \n",

      "    ('abstract', \"The purpose of this paper is to determine whether Systems of Artificial Intelligence (SAI) can be deemed subjects of law. This aim is formulated according to the technical capabilities integrated in SAI and the SAI's ability to interact independently with other legal subjects. SAI features, such as direct connection with intellectual skills, the ability to understand, learn and make autonomous decisions may cause situations where autonomous systems based on AI will make decisions which will be in the best interests of individuals, even though conflicting with the user's own will. To consider the possibility of SAI being recognized as possessing legal personality, we analyse the concept and features of SAI and define its operating principles. We give hypothetical examples to demonstrate the necessity of SAIs being recognized as such. The paper undertakes legal personality analysis of SAI performed: (i) using the philosophical and legal concepts of a subject (person); (ii) discussing artificial (unnatural subjects of law) as an alternative to the recognition of legal personality of SAI; (iii) using elements of legal personality set for natural and legal persons. The analysis leads to the conclusion that the scope of SAI rights and obligations will not necessarily be the same as the scope of rights and obligations of other subjects of law. Thus, SAI could only have rights and obligations that are strictly defined by legislators. This conclusion suggests that the result of this paper may be its use in further research defining the scope of SAI rights and obligations.\"), \n",

Design/methodology/approach: Studies have been conducted through focus group discussion and the other sources such as different company websites using AI, Indian Government strategy reports on AI, literature studies, different policies implemented on AI in different locations and other relevant documents. After those studies, a charter of recommendation has been provided. This will help the authority to frame the AI policy for India. Findings: This study highlights that “National Strategy for AI” for India needs improvement to provide comprehensive inputs for framing policy on AI. This study also implies that focus is to be given on security, privacy issues including issues of governance. Research limitations/implications: AI-related technology has immense potential toward the development of organizations. This study implies the necessity of framing a comprehensive policy on AI for India. If there is a comprehensive policy on AI for India, the Indian industries will derive many benefits. Practical implications: This study provides inputs on how the industries of India can be benefitted with the help of AI and how R&D can develop the AI activities to harness maximum benefits from this innovative technology. Social implications: AI-related policy will have appreciable influence on the society in terms of human–device interactions and communications. The policy framework on AI for India is expected to project far-reaching effects toward deriving benefits to the society.

The principles are described in terms such as growth, innovation, efficiency gains, cybersecurity, malicious use or misuse of AI systems, data use, effects on labour markets, and regulatory environments. The authors also analyse how the strategies describe the link between ethical principles and a competitive advantage, and what measures are proposed to facilitate that link.

While scholars still struggle to agree on a common conceptualization and terminology, it is clear that particular aspects of this new phenomenon have already been addressed by previous work on technology acceptance, satisfaction, or technology diffusion. However, these previous findings do not form a distinct and integrated body of knowledge because no one has yet associated them with the phenomenon of individualization. To address this gap, we suggest an integrated, yet generic, conceptualization of individualization in form of a metatheory. Based on the key entities and relations of the meta-theory, we conduct a structured literature review to identify pre-existing IS contributions to the individualization phenomenon, which help explain the phenomenon of individualization in IS.

This paper explores enterprise architecture roles and capabilities for the adoption of big data analytics by conducting a qualitative case study at the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. The first attempt to adopt big data analytics was focused on integrating analytics into the current complex IT landscape, but this encountered many challenges and resulted in slow progress. To overcome these challenges, a separate department was created to quickly harness the potential of big data analytics. Enterprise architecture was used for impact analysis and to create a transition process. The findings suggest that enterprise architecture was used in different ways at the various stages of adoption and implementation, requiring different roles and a different set of capabilities. Enterprise architecture was found to be contingent on the type of technology and the situation at hand. We recommend more research into the role of the context in enterprise architecture research.'), \n",

Most investment models for enterprise‐wide development projects usually do not take into account the automation's costs, including the design and implementation of information systems. The Enterprise Architecture (EA) paradigm has been proposed to bridge the gap between the business and the IT sector. The study aims to develop investment models for projects for the implementation and development of EA solutions, including IT architectures that eliminate the shortcomings of existing approaches. The research methodology is based on the analysis of published approaches to investment models for projects creating and developing EA, IT architectures with the identification of their advantages and limitations, and on the analysis of IT investment assessment practices in Russian infrastructure‐intensive companies. As a result, investment and appraisal models are proposed that have advantages associated with the ability to calculate the effect of an integrated approach to the implementation of IT solutions, a more accurate calculation of an investment project cost by taking into account the IT system's cost, a reduction in the investment cycle of development and implementation of architectural solutions, including physical and IT component.\"), \n",

Strategies of adaptive governance include utilizing internal and external capabilities, decentralizing decision-making power, and seeking to inform higher-level decisions from bottom-up. At the same time, adaptive strategies may challenge stability and accountability, which remain essential for governments.

Despite the shortcomings of human control over complex technical systems, human oversight is advocated as a solution against the risks of increasing reliance on algorithmic tools. For law, human oversight provides an attractive, easily implementable and observable procedural safeguard. However, without awareness of its inherent limitations, human oversight is in danger of becoming a value in itself, an empty procedural shell used as a stand-in justification for algorithmization but failing to provide protection for fundamental rights. By complementing socio-legal analysis with Science and Technology Studies, critical algorithm studies, organization studies and human-computer interaction research, the author explores the importance of keeping the human in the loop and asks what the human element at the core of legal decision making is. Through algorithmization it is made visible how law conceptualises decision making through human actors, personalises legal decision making through the decision-maker's discretionary power that provides proportionality and common sense, prevents gross miscarriages of justice and establishes the human encounter deemed essential for the feeling of being heard. The analysis demonstrates the necessary human element embedded in legal decision making, against which the meaningfulness of human oversight needs to be examined.\"), \n",

It questions how external actors overtly or covertly influence formulation of a national ICT policy following that nearly 84% of the countries in Africa have formulated national ICT policies most of which have been influenced by external actors. The paper uses Bourdieu's Theory of Practice to analyse effects of external actors' influences in developing countries using Malawi as the case. Document analysis is used to analyse external actors' influences in policy documents, minutes of policy actors' meetings and policy reports. The paper finds that developing countries cannot do without the contribution of external actors in the formulation of national ICT policies. The study did not identify any link between policy formulation and country context. The findings offer stakeholders of public policy important insights into how they can manage external actors during the policy process.\"), \n",

      "    ('abstract', \"The rush to understand new socio-economic contexts created by the wide adoption of AI is justified by its far-ranging consequences, spanning almost every walk of life. Yet, the public sector's predicament is a tragic double bind: its obligations to protect citizens from potential algorithmic harms are at odds with the temptation to increase its own efficiency - or in other words - to govern algorithms, while governing by algorithms. Whether such dual role is even possible, has been a matter of debate, the challenge stemming from algorithms' intrinsic properties, that make them distinct from other digital solutions, long embraced by the governments, create externalities that rule-based programming lacks. As the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector become prevalent, this paper aims to examine how the use of AI in the public sector in relation to existing data governance regimes and national regulatory practices can be intensifying existing power asymmetries. To this end, investigating the legal and policy instruments associated with the use of AI for strenghtening the immigration process control system in Canada; “optimising” the employment services” in Poland, and personalising the digital service experience in Finland, the paper advocates for the need of a common framework to evaluate the potential impact of the use of AI in the public sector. In this regard, it discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are controlled and possibly avoided. This is of particular importance in light of the current COVID-19 emergency crisis where AI and the underpinning regulatory framework of data ecosystems, have become crucial policy issues as more and more innovations are based on large scale data collections from digital devices, and the real-time accessibility of information and services, contact and relationships between institutions and citizens could strengthen – or undermine - trust in governance systems and democracy.\"), \n",

Complex statistical algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being used to automate decision-making and are having a significant impact on individuals' rights and obligations. Controversies have emerged regarding the opaque nature of such schemes, the unintentional bias against and harm to under-represented populations, and the broader legal, social and ethical ramifications. State v Loomis, a recent case in the USA, well demonstrates how unrestrained and unchecked outsourcing of public power to machines may undermine human rights and the rule of law. With a close examination of the case, this article unpacks the issues of the 'legal black box' and the 'technical black box' to identify the risks posed by rampant 'algorithmization' of government functions to due process, equal protection and transparency. We further assess some important governance proposals and suggest ways for improving the accountability of AI-facilitated decisions. As AI systems are commonly employed in consequential settings across jurisdictions, technologically informed governance models are needed to locate optimal institutional designs that strike a balance between the benefits and costs of algorithmization.\"), \n",

AI is the programming or training of a computer to do tasks typically reserved for human intelligence, whether it is recommending which movie to watch next or answering technical questions. Soon, AI will permeate the ways we interact with our government, too. From small cities in the US to countries like Japan, government agencies are looking to AI to improve citizen services. While the potential future use cases of AI in government remain bounded by gov- ernment resources and the limits of both human creativity and trust in government, the most obvious and immediately beneficial opportunities are those where AI can reduce administrative burdens, help resolve resource allocation problems, and take on signifi- cantly complex tasks. Many AI case studies in citizen services today fall into five cat- egories: answering questions, filling out and searching documents, routing requests, translation, and drafting documents. These applications could make government work more efficient while freeing up time for employees to build better relationships with citizens. With citizen satisfaction with digital government offerings leaving much to be desired, AI may be one way to bridge the gap while improving citizen engagement and service delivery.'), ('file', ':E\\\\:/Users/Su/OneDrive/Learning/MS Computer Science/Research/AI/artificial_intelligence_for_citizen_services.pdf:pdf'), \n",

Yet, the use of AI in public organizations in still lagging significantly compared to private organizations. Prior literature looking into aspects that facilitate adoption and use of AI has concentrated on challenges concerning technical aspects of AI technologies, providing little insight regarding the organizational deployment of AI, particularly in public organizations. Building on this gap, this study seeks to examine what aspects enable public organizations to develop AI capabilities. To answer this question, we built an integrated and extended model from the Technology-Organization-Environment framework (TOE) and asked high-level technology managers from municipalities in Europe about factors that influence their development of AI capabilities. We collected data from 91 municipalities from three European countries (i.e., Germany, Norway, and Finland) and analyzed responses by means of structural equation modeling. Our findings indicate that five factors – i.e. perceived financial costs, organizational innovativeness, perceived governmental pressure, government incentives, regulatory support – have an impact on the development of AI capabilities. We also find that perceived citizen pressure and perceived value of AI solutions are not important determinants of AI capability formation. Our findings bear the potential to stimulate a more reflected adoption of AI supporting managers in public organizations to develop AI capabilities.'), \n",

      "    ('abstract', 'Purpose: This paper aims to develop a simple model for estimating sustainable development goals index using the capabilities of artificial neural networks. Design/methodology/approach: Sustainable development has three pillars, including social, economic and environmental pillars. Three clusters corresponding to the three pillars were created by extracting sub-indices of three 2018 global reports and performing cluster analysis on the correlation matrix of sub-indices. By setting the sustainable development goals index as the target variable and selecting one indicator from each cluster as input variables, 20 artificial neural networks were run 30 times. Findings: Artificial neural networks with seven nodes in one hidden layer can estimate sustainable development goals index by using just three inputs, including ecosystem vitality, human capital and gross national income per capita. There is an excellent similarity (>95%) between the results of the artificial neural network and the sustainable development goals index. Practical implications: Instead of calculating 232 indicators for determining the value of sustainable development goals index, it is possible to use only three sub-indices, but missing 5% of precision, by using the proposed artificial neural network model. Originality/value: The study provides additional information on the estimating of sustainable development and proposes a new simple method for estimating the sustainable development goals index. It just uses three sub-indices, which can be retrieved from three global reports.'), \n",

These data are often processed by algorithms, which support (or drive) decisions (termed 'algorithmic decision-making' in this article). While the strategic value of these data (and subsequent analysis) for businesses is unquestionable, the implications for individuals and wider society are less clear. Therefore, in this Viewpoint article we aim to shed light on the tension between businesses - that increasingly profile customers and personalize products and services - and individuals, who, as McAfee and Brynjolfsson (2012, p. 5) suggest, are 'walking data generators' but are often unaware of how the data they produce are being used, and by whom and with what consequences. Issues associated with privacy, control and dependence arise, suggesting that social and ethical concerns related to the way business is strategically exploiting digitized technologies that increasingly support our everyday activities should be brought to the fore and thoughtfully discussed. In this article we aim to lay a foundation for this discussion in the IS community and beyond.\"), \n",

      "    ('abstract', 'Today there is widespread expectation about how ubiquitous data and intelligent systems may revolutionize society towards shared prosperity; or conversely, deepen social inequalities, bring the end of human agency, and forgo the right to privacy. In this two-part thesis, we investigate the societal value and perils of hybrid decision systems—which integrate elements of human and artificial intelligence. Part I of this thesis focuses on their potential for promoting social development goals, with applications in poverty alleviation and public health. Towards public health, in the context of early detection of diabetic blindness, we show that human- AI hybrid systems can be more accurate than either human or algorithm in isolation, and that both opinions benefit from mutual exposure. Towards improved poverty action, we argue that poverty-targeting rules are among the most relevant algorithms operating in the world today. We demonstrate that a shift towards the use of AI methods in poverty-based targeting can substantially increase accuracy, extending the coverage of social policies by nearly a million people in the case of two Latin American countries, without increasing budgets. However, it is also shown that both the status quo and AI-systems induce disparities across population subgroups. Hence, we close by proposing a decision support tool that empowers diverse social institutions to design fair targeting rules under a distributed governance framework. Part II addresses cross-cutting challenges that arise as one applies these tech- nologies in real-world domains towards social development. In particular, the work presented provides academic and practical contributions on: 1) achieving fairness in algorithmic decision systems by means of adaptive information collection, a novel paradigm we call active fairness; and 2) preserving privacy and mapping its tradeoff against utility in development contexts.

Based on the results of these analyses, a subsequent broader analysis is provided, from a position vantage, to (i) identify the efforts made in applying AI technologies in SDGs, (ii) pinpoint opportunities for further progress along the current decade, and (iii) distill ongoing challenges and target areas for important advances. The analysis is organized into six categories or perspectives of human needs: life, economic and technological development, social development, equality, resources and natural environment.

However, it remains challenging for practitioners to identify the harmful repercussions of their own systems prior to deployment, and, once deployed, emergent issues can become difficult or impossible to trace back to their source. In this paper, we introduce a framework for algorithmic auditing that supports artificial intelligence system development end-to-end, to be applied throughout the internal organization development lifecycle. Each stage of the audit yields a set of documents that together form an overall audit report, drawing on an organization's values or principles to assess the fit of decisions made throughout the process. The proposed auditing framework is intended to contribute to closing the accountability gap in the development and deployment of large-scale artificial intelligence systems by embedding a robust process to ensure audit integrity.\"), \n",

The goal of this report is to present a realistic baseline that allows companies to compare their AI ambitions and efforts. Building on data rather than conjecture, the research is based on a global survey of more than 3,000 executives, managers, and analysts across industries and in-depth interviews with more than 30 technology experts and executives. (See “About the Research,” page 2.) The gap between ambition and execution is large at most companies. Three-quarters of executives believe AI will enable their companies to move into new businesses. Almost 85% believe AI will allow their companies to obtain or sustain a competitive advantage. But only about one in five com- panies has incorporated AI in some offerings or processes. Only one in 20 companies has extensively incorporated AI in offerings or processes. Less than 39% of all companies have an AI strategy in place. The largest companies — those with at least 100,000 employees — are the most likely to have an AI strategy, but only half have one. Our research reveals large gaps between today's leaders — companies that already understand and have adopted AI — and laggards. One sizeable difference is their approach to data. AI algorithms are not natively “intelligent.” They learn inductively by analyzing data. While most leaders are invest- ing in AI talent and have built robust information infrastructures, other companies lack analytics expertise and easy access to their data. Our research surfaced several misunderstandings about the resources needed to train AI. The leaders not only have a much deeper appreciation about what's required to produce AI than laggards, they are also more likely to have senior leadership support and have developed a business case for AI initiativ\"), \n",

Where many AI processes are technologies hidden from view of the citizen, how can public institutions support and ensure these high levels of trust, transparency, and openness in Nordic culture and extend these concepts of “digital trust” to AI? One solution is by authoring national policy that upholds cultural values and personal rights, ultimately reinforcing these values in their societies. The paper highlights differences in how Nordic nations position themselves using cultural values as organizing principles, with the author showing these values (i.e., trust through clear information and information security, transparency through AI literacy education and clear algorithmic decision making, and openness by creating data lakes and data trusts) support the development of AI technology in society. The analysis shows that three cultural values are upheld and influence Nordic national AI strategies, while themes of privacy, ethics, and autonomy are present, and democracy, a societal building block in the Nordics, is especially prominent in the policies. For policy development, policy leaders must understand that without citizen involvement in AI implementation or lacking citizen AI education, we risk alienating those for who these services are meant to utilize and improve access for.\"), \n",

      "    ('abstract', 'The Digital Transformation era has unlocked unique opportunities for organizations to disrupt and innovate with new products and services by leveraging novel emerging technologies such as mobile computing, big data analytics, cloud computing, and the internet of things. The range of possibilities provided by Digital Transformations comes at the expense of constant change across multiple levels of the enterprise including organizational structures, operational processes, business strategies, and even corporate culture. In addition, highly competitive market conditions introduced by the new digital era have forced organizations to react quicker than ever before, pressuring organizations to employ faster learning cycles that translate into shorter time-tomarket strategies. Lastly, Digital Transformations revolutionize the way in which IT and business units collaborate where extremely cohesive teams are expected to continuously innovate and deliver solutions that result in enhanced customer journeys and experiences driven by new corporate cultures. Facing the challenges brought by the new digital era not only requires the adoption of emerging technologies, but committing to best practices that allow organizations to execute successful Digital Transformations. Conventionally, Enterprise Architecture has proven to be the discipline that best provides a basis for highly integrated environments, that are responsive to change and supportive in the delivery of the business strategy. However, organizations that have allocated resources and great efforts to become truly digital, criticize the Enterprise Architecture practice as it fails to grasp the fundamental concepts from the nature of Digital Transformations. Certainly, such discontent has drawn attention to perform this research. In response to these adversities, organizations must tackle these challenges systematically by embracing new or enhanced approaches that enable them to stay ahead of the competition while keeping up the pace of the new digital generation. The main objective of this research is to design, validate, and evaluate an Enterprise Architecture framework that stimulates business agility, simplifies architecture development, and promotes collaboration across business and IT units in order to lead organizations to successful Digital Transformations. To structure the research a Desing Science Research Methodology (DSRM) is applied. Based on the results from performing a Systematic Literature Review in preparation for this thesis and the examination of a case study of a well-known multinational company, the Enterprise Architecture Framework for Digital Transformation is assembled and validated in the context of the Data and Analytics initiative at Apollo Vredestein B.V. Furthermore, three expert interviews carried out as part of the evaluation process corroborated that the effects produced by the artifact satisfy the main research objective of this thesis. At the same time, a series of improvements are suggested for the presented framework. Lastly, conclusions are drawn, limitations are outlined and future research directions are provided.'), \n",

Advances in digital technologies, their role, and significance in techno managerial ICT solutions are examined to provide a knowledge base for assessing capabilities, possibilities, and utilities to researchers, economists, policy and decision makers for optimal resources utilization, and stimulating economic growth. Besides contributing to the fields of information systems research and growth literature, few indicators are listed for consideration in economic analysis. This broadens vision for optimizing systems infrastructure, innovation activities, and helps establish their effects on growth. The study proposes that supporting policies in combination with adequate funds provision, stable government, macro-economic determinants, and innovation environment are crucial for ICT-induced prosperity. Additionally, countries need to promote e-commerce and e-governance activities with adequate R&D support, technical support, deployment of probots knowbots and chatbots powered by artificial intelligence, autonomic computing applications, transfer of technology to industry and society, enforcement toward acceptance of digitization, and use-based rewards.

Still, a common understanding and methodological consistency seems far from being developed. Acknowledging the significant role of research in moving the development process along, this article employs different bibliometric methods, complemented by an extensive qualitative interpretation of the research field, to provide a unique overview of the enterprise architecture literature. After answering our research questions about the collaboration via co-authorships, the intellectual structure of the research field and its most influential works, and the principal themes of research, we propose an agenda for future research based on the findings from the above analyses and their comparison to empirical insights from the literature. In particular, our study finds a considerable degree of co-authorship clustering and a positive impact of the extent of co-authorship on the diffusion of works on enterprise architecture. In addition, this article identifies three major research streams and shows that research to date has revolved around specific themes, while some of high practical relevance receive minor attention.

The approach acknowledges the relevance of AI Ethics Principles and homes in on methodological elements to increase their practical implementability in policy processes. As a case study, elements are extracted from the development process of the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI of the European Commission's “High Level Expert Group on AI”. Subsequently, these elements are expanded on and evaluated in light of their ability to contribute to a prototype framework for the development of 'Actionable Principles for AI'. The paper proposes the following three propositions for the formation of such a prototype framework: (1) preliminary landscape assessments; (2) multi-stakeholder participation and cross-sectoral feedback; and, (3) mechanisms to support implementation and operationalizability.\"), \n",

      "    ('abstract', 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a set of technologies through which “intelligent machines are gaining the ability to learn, improve and make calculated decisions in ways that enable them to perform tasks previously thought to rely solely on human experience, creativity, and ingenuity” [2]. As stated in the 2018 the UN E-Government Survey, major technological developments in software and hardware have enhanced the advancement of AI and its potential impact on society. Increased data collection and usage are magnifying the learning process of computers and improving the quality of AI systems which are heavily data-dependent. On the one hand, AI holds the promise to be a catalyst in accelerating development and allowing developing countries to leapfrog over some traditional obstacles. On the other hand, it brings along challenges such as its impact on the workforce, the ethical implications of some of its applications, and the need for capacity-building which would essentially overhaul the kind of education required for the next generation. This working paper analyzes the above issues from a public sector angle and raises questions which should be considered by public administrators and those working on digital government development in particular. Moreover, the analyses are built on the 2018 United Nations E-Government Survey findings and the working paper is expected to be discussed in detail in the preparatory meetings leading to the next edition of the United Nations E-Government Survey.'), \n",

However, such a notion also has a great potential to be transferred and understood in the digital government context, where there is an increasing need to establish forms of collaboration that can respond to swift changes in the environment related to technology and citizen demands. Drawing on the analysis of four cases of IT-related project collaboration, we put forward that the degree of sharing of decision-making power and of accountability between government and non-government actors is critical to developing different types of adaptive governance. Findings show that the distribution of decision-making power and of accountability can be decoupled, resulting in three types of adaptive governance – namely polycentric, agile, and organic governance. We contribute to research by detailing and empirically testing the notion of adaptive governance in a digital government context, and to practice by highlighting the role of the distribution of decision-making power and of accountability in devising adaptive governance strategies.'), \n",

      "    ('abstract', 'To lay the foundation for the special issue that this research article introduces, we present 1) a systematic review of existing literature on the implications of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in public governance and 2) develop a research agenda. First, an assessment based on 26 articles on this topic reveals much exploratory, conceptual, qualitative, and practice-driven research in studies reflecting the increasing complexities of using AI in government – and the resulting implications, opportunities, and risks thereof for public governance. Second, based on both the literature review and the analysis of articles included in this special issue, we propose a research agenda comprising eight process-related recommendations and seven content-related recommendations. Process-wise, future research on the implications of the use of AI for public governance should move towards more public sector-focused, empirical, multidisciplinary, and explanatory research while focusing more on specific forms of AI rather than AI in general. Content-wise, our research agenda calls for the development of solid, multidisciplinary, theoretical foundations for the use of AI for public governance, as well as investigations of effective implementation, engagement, and communication plans for government strategies on AI use in the public sector. Finally, the research agenda calls for research into managing the risks of AI use in the public sector, governance modes possible for AI use in the public sector, performance and impact measurement of AI use in government, and impact evaluation of scaling-up AI usage in the public sector.'), \n",
